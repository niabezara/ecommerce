I created a reusable ProductCard component to keep the code modular and clean, arranging these cards within a Bootstrap grid layout for consistent spacing and alignment. The layout adapts responsively using Bootstrapâ€™s grid classes (col-md-4, col-sm-6, col-12), ensuring the product cards display nicely on desktop, tablet, and mobile screens without layout issues. This approach provides a clean, user-friendly interface across all device sizes.
